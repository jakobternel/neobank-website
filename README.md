## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This fictional digital bank website was created to deepen my expertise in mobile-first development, focusing on seamless user experiences enhanced by animations and microinteractions.

As my second project using Tailwind CSS, I aimed to advance my skills in responsive design, implement light & dark mode themes, and explore advanced CSS selectors. Additionally, this project gave me hands-on experience with Three.js and WebGL to create engaging 3D visuals and effects.
